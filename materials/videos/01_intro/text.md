In this course we will be looking at some of the most recent additions to javascript with a special emphasis on how these new pieces of syntax can be used to write cleaner and more efficient React code.

If you haven't used React much, don't worry. We won't be diving too deeply into the framework though some familiarity might be useful.

Over the duration of this course, you can expect to practice: importing and exporting, const and let variable declaration, promises, template literals, arrow functions, and some cool ways you can implement spread operators, destructuring assignments, and classes in your react projects.

Before we go any further however, I want to take a second to clear up some confusion around the terms es5, es6, es7, and es2015, es2016 --

Why do people keep saying es6, es7, but then what's ecmascript 2016 -- aren't we writing javascript?

So what is it? Well, most of that is right.

The language we're writing is still called javascript. But you should know that the governing organization which releases the standardized specifications for javascript is called the European Computer Manufactuerers Association -- or ECMA. And they're the ones who are in charge of telling all the programmers and people who make browsers what is and isn't really javascript.

Now, javascript was originally written back in 1997 and since then, ECMA has been updated 7 different times -- and each of those editions has been known as es1, es2, all the way to es6 which –– actually, the people at ecma decided to later rename es2015 with the hope that new editions would be released yearly and that those editions would be identified by their year.

In this course we are going to be reviewing a number of the specifications that were added in es2015 because that was a fairly sizable update –– and it included many of the iconic updates like const and let and the arrow function and because it is largely what people think of when they think of es-whatever.

But we are also going to review some syntax that was in es2016 and even some syntax that isn't in any ecma specification yet but that can be transpiled using the same programs that we'll be using in our project –– and may well be in the upcoming es2017

I find its always easiest to pick up new skills when I get to put them to use on a project. So, to help get us some practice with cool new syntax we're going to learn, we are going to implement them in a fun project I've been working  on.

In my free time I like to do some creative writing in addition to writing code. Ever since I began programming, I've been drawn to aesthetically unique way that interactive development editors –– like Atom or Sublime Text highlight the different parts of a scripts syntax.

So in this project, we're going to be building our own ide of sorts that will allow use to create our own language and syntax styling rules and then apply those to our own work –– or a random work online.

Let's check out the finished product so that we can see what we're working towards .
